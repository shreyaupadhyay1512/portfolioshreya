    <h2 id="topic1">1. What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure the content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each enclosed in angle brackets, which define the structure and semantics of the content. HTML elements can include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and more. These elements form the building blocks of a web page, allowing developers to organize and present information in a structured manner. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers, which render the content according to the instructions provided by the HTML code.</p>

    <h2 id="topic2">2. What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It provides a way to style the visual aspects of web pages, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. They can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, or even their relationship with other elements.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. With CSS, developers can control the appearance of HTML elements by specifying styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS separates the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and consistency in design. Styles can be applied directly to HTML elements or grouped into reusable classes and IDs, making it easier to manage and maintain the styling of a website. CSS also supports advanced layout techniques such as flexbox and grid, enabling developers to create complex and responsive layouts with ease. </p>

    <h2 id="topic3">3. What is JS?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. As the primary scripting language of the web, JavaScript allows developers to manipulate the HTML content, respond to user actions, and interact with the browser and its environment. With JavaScript, developers can create interactive features such as animations, form validation, dynamic content updates, and more. JavaScript code is executed on the client-side, meaning it runs within the user's web browser, enabling rich and responsive web applications without the need for server-side processing.</p>

    <h2 id="topic4">4. What is XML?</h2>
    <p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML that is designed to store and transport structured data. Unlike HTML, which is primarily used for displaying content in web browsers, XML focuses on describing the structure and organization of data in a platform-independent manner. XML documents consist of nested elements with user-defined tags, allowing developers to create custom data formats tailored to their specific needs. XML is commonly used for data interchange between different systems and applications, as well as for configuration files, document storage, and data representation in web services such as SOAP and RSS.</p>
